Title:&nbsp; Loop group action on symplectic cohomology

Abstract:&nbsp; For a compact Lie group G, its massless Coulomb branch algebra is the G-equivariant Borel-Moore homology of its based loop space. This algebra is the same as the algebra of regular functions on the BFM space. In this talk, we will explain how this algebra acts on the equivariant symplectic cohomology of Hamiltonian G-manifolds when the symplectic manifolds are open and convex. This is a generalization of the closed case where symplectic cohomology is replaced with quantum cohomology. Following Teleman, we also explain how it relates to the Coulomb branch algebra of cotangent-type representations. This is joint work with Eduardo González and Dan Pomerleano.

Speaker:&nbsp; **Andrew Dancer** (University of Oxford)

Title:&nbsp; Implosion, contraction and nonreductive quotients

Abstract:&nbsp; We describe the constructions of implosion and contraction for
complex-symplectic or hyperkahler manifolds. Implosions are examples
of nonreductive quotients in geometric invariant theory. We can
interpret both constructions in terms of a generalisation of the
Moore-Tachikawa category that was introduced in physics.

Title:&nbsp; Applications of Laurent inversion to K-moduli

Abstract:&nbsp; I will discuss how to use Laurent inversion, a technique coming from mirror symmetry which constructs toric embeddings, to study the local structure of the K-moduli space of a K-polystable toric Fano variety. More specifically, starting from a toric Fano 3-fold X of anticanonical volume 28 which smooths to a Fano threefold of Picard rank 4, we combine a local study of its singularities with the global deformation provided by Laurent inversion, and conclude that the K-moduli space is rational around X. This is joint work with Andrea Petracci.
