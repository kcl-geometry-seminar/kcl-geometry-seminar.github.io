The Seminar runs on *Tuesdays* at **STRAND BLDG S4.29**. This term, some talks will run from *15:00 to 16:00*, and others will be in two parts -- an introductory talk from *15:00 to 15:40* and a research talk from *15:45 to 16:30*.

29 April,  Part I: 15:00-15:40, Part II: 15:45-16:30, STRAND BLDG S4.29

Speaker:&nbsp; **Alapan Mukhopadhyay** (EPFL)

Title:&nbsp; Frobenius and Homological Algebra

Abstract:&nbsp; The Frobenius endomorphism or the p-th power map is crucial in
defining singularity classes in characteristic p > 0, especially those appearing
in the birational classification of algebraic varieties. On the other hand, the
obstruction to smoothness is homological, according to a celebrated theorem of
Serre. In this talk, we will show that the Frobenius endomorphism witnesses this
homological obstruction to smoothness. This provides an explanation for the
effectiveness of Frobenius in detecting singularities, from a homological point of
view. The key will be to produce (explicit) generators of the bounded derived
category of a variety in characteristic p > 0 from perfect complexes using the
Frobenius pushforward functor. Our results recover earlier characterizations of
smoothness using Frobenius- such as Kunz’s theorem. Time permitting, we will
discuss examples hinting relationship between generators of derived categories
and the global geometry of the underlying projective variety. Part of the talk
will report a joint work with Matthew Ballard, Patrick Lank, Srikanth Iyengar
and Josh Pollitz.

Title:&nbsp; Extracting subcomplexes in the subRiemannian setting





Abstract:&nbsp; On subRiemannian manifolds, the de Rham complex is not the ideal candidate to use to carry out geometric analysis. However, special subcomplexes have successfully been applied in very specific settings, such as Heisenberg groups and the Cartan group. I will give an overview of different techniques used to obtain such subcomplexes, as well as point out their limitations when used on arbitrary Carnot groups, and a possible way to overcome them.
