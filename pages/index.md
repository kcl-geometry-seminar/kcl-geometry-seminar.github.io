Title:&nbsp; Homology stability for generalised Hurwitz spaces and asymptotic monopoles

Abstract:&nbsp; Configuration spaces have played an important role in mathematics and its applications. In particular, the question of how their topology changes as the cardinality of the underlying configuration changes has been studied for some fifty years and has attracted renewed attention in the last decade. 

While classically additional information is associated "locally" to the points of the configuration, there are interesting examples when this additional information is "non-local". With Martin Palmer we have studied homology stability in some of these cases, including Hurwitz space and moduli spaces of asymptotic monopoles.
