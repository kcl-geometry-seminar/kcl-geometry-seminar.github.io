Title:&nbsp;  On the deformation theory of L-foliations

Abstract:&nbsp;  We will review some general concepts of deformation theory. Then we will apply these ideas in order to explore the geometry of the moduli space $Inv$ of foliations on a given variety $X$  around the points corresponding to foliations induced by Lie group actions.  More precisely, let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers and $S(d)$ the scheme parametrizing $d$-dimensional Lie subalgebras of $H^0(X,\mathcal{T} X)$.  For every $\mathfrak{g} \in S(d)$ one can consider the corresponding element $\mathcal{F}(\mathfrak{g})\in Inv$, whose generic leaf coincides with an orbit of the action of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ on $X$. We will show that under mild hypotheses, after taking a stratification $\coprod_i S(d)_i\to S(d)$ this assignment yields an isomorphism $\coprod_i S(d)_i\to Inv$ locally around $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathcal{F}(\mathfrak{g})$.

Title:&nbsp; Cohomogeneity-one Lagrangian Mean Curvature Flow

Abstract:&nbsp; Mean Curvature Flow, the negative gradient flow for the volume functional of submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds, is a well-studied field of modern geometric analysis. Of particular interest are classifications of self-similar solutions (shrinkers, expanders, and translators) and finite-time singularities; projects which when completed will hopefully allow one to apply the flow to prove results in Riemannian geometry and differential topology. Moreover, in a Calabi-Yau manifold the class of Lagrangian submanifolds is preserved by mean curvature flow, a fact which inspired Thomas and Yau to make influential conjectures about existence of special Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau manifolds.

In this talk, we aim to make progress towards an understanding of self-similar solutions and singularities of Lagrangian mean curvature flow, by focusing on Lagrangians in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that are cohomogeneity-one under the action of a compact Lie group. Interestingly, each such Lagrangian lies in a level set $\mu^{-1}(c)$ of the moment map $\mu$, and mean curvature flow preserves this containment.  Using this, we classify all shrinking, expanding, and translating solitons, and in the zero level set $\mu^{-1}(0)$, we classify the Type I and Type II blowup models of LMCF singularities. Finally, given any special Lagrangian in $\mu^{-1}(0)$, we'll show that it arises as a Type II blowup, thereby yielding infinitely many new singularity models of Lagrangian mean curvature flow.

The results presented in this talk are contained in the preprint ‘Cohomogeneity-One Lagrangian Mean Curvature Flow’, which is jointly written with Jesse Madnick, University of Oregon.

Title:&nbsp; Steklov eigenvalues of negatively curved manifolds

Abstract:&nbsp; The geometry and topology of negatively curved manifolds are subtly reflected in a geometric bound for the Laplace eigenvalues, a connection that has been explored since the 1980s. Building upon these foundational studies in the case of the Laplacian, we investigate the Steklov eigenvalues of pinched negatively curved manifolds with totally geodesic boundary. These eigenvalues are associated with a first-order elliptic pseudodifferential operator known as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. We discuss how the results for Laplace eigenvalues can be extended to Steklov eigenvalues. In particular, we show a spectral gap for the Steklov eigenvalue problem in negatively curved manifolds with dimensions of at least three.
This talk is based on joint work with Ara Basjmaian, Jade Brisson, and Antoine Métras.
