The Seminar runs on *Tuesdays* at **STRAND BLDG S4.29**. This term, some talks will run from *15:00 to 16:00*, and others will be in two parts -- an introductory talk from *15:00 to 15:40* and a research talk from *15:45 to 16:30*.

Title:&nbsp; Quiver varieties for the working geometer

Abstract:&nbsp; This talk is divided into two related, yet self-contained sections. The first section is an elementary introduction to (Nakajima) quiver varieties, beginning with representations of quivers and emphasizing small examples. The second section shifts gears to symplectic resolutions of singularities, including the minimal resolutions of du Val singularities and the Springer resolution of the nilpotent cone of a Lie algebra.

The sections unite as we construct symplectic resolutions for quiver varieties by varying a stability parameter. In joint work with Travis Schedler, we leverage these symplectic resolutions to build resolutions for spaces that are (analytically) locally quiver varieties. The key idea here is to choose local resolutions at the most singular points and then demonstrate that certain compatible, monodromy-free choices extend and glue to a global resolution.

Title:&nbsp; Homology stability for generalised Hurwitz spaces and asymptotic monopoles

Abstract:&nbsp; Configuration spaces have played an important role in mathematics and its applications. In particular, the question of how their topology changes as the cardinality of the underlying configuration changes has been studied for some fifty years and has attracted renewed attention in the last decade. 

While classically additional information is associated "locally" to the points of the configuration, there are interesting examples when this additional information is "non-local". With Martin Palmer we have studied homology stability in some of these cases, including Hurwitz space and moduli spaces of asymptotic monopoles.

7 May, Part I: 15:00-15:40, Part II: 15:45-16:30, STRAND BLDG S4.29

Speaker:&nbsp; **Ilaria Di Dedda** (King's College London)

Title:&nbsp; Type A symplectic Auslander correspondence

Abstract:&nbsp; In this talk, we will study invariants of complex isolated hypersurface singularities. In the first half I will review the basics of Floer theory, and I will describe Fukaya-Seidel categories, a powerful and geometric derived invariant of singularities. In the second half, I will describe invariants of a special family of isolated singularities, whose Fukaya-Seidel categories play an important role in bordered Heegaard Floer theory. Motivated by representation theory, I will relate these singularities to abstract objects associated to algebras of type A (named after the quiver of Dynkin type A). I will introduce “type A symplectic Auslander correspondence”, a purely geometrical construction which realises a notable result in representation theory. Most of the talk will be example-based.
