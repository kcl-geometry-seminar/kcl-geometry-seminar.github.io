The Seminar runs on *Tuesdays* at **STRAND BLDG S5.20**. This term, some talks will run from *15:00 to 16:00*, and others will be in two parts -- an introductory talk from *15:00 to 15:40* and a research talk from *15:45 to 16:30*.

Title:&nbsp;Sasaki–Einstein metrics on spheres

Abstract:&nbsp; The differential geometry of spheres has long been a source of central problems in mathematics, and Sasaki–Einstein metrics—odd-dimensional analogues of Kähler–Einstein metrics—offer a particularly rich perspective, with significance both in geometry and in theoretical physics. In joint work with Yuchen Liu and Taro Sano, we construct infinitely many Sasaki–Einstein metrics on odd-dimensional spheres that bound parallelizable manifolds, thereby confirming conjectures of Boyer–Galicki–Kollár and Collins–Székelyhidi. Our approach is based on establishing the K-stability of certain Fano weighted hypersurfaces.

Speaker:&nbsp; **Hannah Tillmann-Morris** (KCL)

Title:&nbsp;Birational mirrors to pairs of Laurent polynomials

Abstract:&nbsp; Under mirror symmetry, deformation classes of Fano varieties are 
associated to mutation classes of maximally mutable Laurent polynomials 
(MMLPs). We expect birational relationships between the general members 
of two deformation classes to be reflected, in the pair of mirror 
mutation classes, as combinatorial relationships between two MMLPs.

I will present an alternative construction of a Fano variety that is 
mirror to a given MMLP, which uses mirror theorems of the Gross-Siebert 
program. The resulting Fano variety is difficult to describe explicitly. 
However, when two given MMLPs are related by certain combinatorial 
conditions, the construction can be extended to include the construction 
of a birational map between the two Fano varieties produced.

Applying all this to rigid MMLPs in two variables recovers all but one 
of the blow-ups in the chain of smooth del Pezzo surfaces.

Speaker:&nbsp; **Roney Santos** (King's College London)

Title:&nbsp; Stability of minimal submanifolds

Abstract:&nbsp; We aim to introduce and discuss some concepts and results on the stability of minimal submanifolds, mainly when the ambient manifold is conformal either to a round sphere or to a convex domain of the Euclidean space. In particular, we will talk about a joint work with Alcides de Carvalho and Federico Trinca, in which we showed that a conformally Euclidean manifold with convex boundary does not admit volume-minimizing free boundary minimal submanifolds.
