Title:&nbsp; New examples of $\mathrm{SU}(2)^2$-invariant $\mathrm{G}_2$-instantons

Abstract:&nbsp; $\mathrm{G}_2$-instantons are a special kind of connections on a Riemannian $7$-manifold, analogues of anti-self-dual connections in $4$ dimensions. I will start this talk by describing $\mathrm{G}_2$-instantons and giving an overview of known examples and why are we interested in them. Then, I will explain how we construct $\mathrm{G}_2$-instantons in $\mathrm{SU}(2)^2$-invariant cohomogeneity one manifolds and give new explicit examples of $\mathrm{G}_2$-instantons on $\mathbb{R}^4 \times \mathbb{S}^3$ and $\mathbb{S}^4 \times \mathbb{S}^3$. I will then discuss the bubbling behaviour of sequences of $\mathrm{G}_2$-instantons found.

Title:&nbsp; Hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature and Einstein hypersurfaces in product spaces

Abstract:&nbsp; Let $M$ be either the unit $n$-sphere or the $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space, with $n>3$. Using graphs over families of parallel hypersurfaces in $M$, I will present existence results for symmetric hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in $M \times \mathbb{R}$. The technique will also be applied to show that an Einstein hypersurface in $M \times \mathbb{R}$ has constant sectional curvature. Finally, employing such graphs, I will provide new proofs of the main results by Manfio and Tojeiro on the classification of constant sectional curvature hypersurfaces in $M \times \mathbb{R}$. The talk is based on two joint works: with de Lima and Ramos (regarding the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature) and with Leandro and Pina (on the Einstein hypersurfaces).

Title:&nbsp; Irreducible cone spherical metrics and stable vector bundles

Abstract:&nbsp; Cone spherical metrics on compact Riemann surfaces are conformal metrics of constant curvature $+1$ with finitely many conical singularities. They are called $\textit{irreducible}$ if any developing maps of such metrics don't have monodromy in $\mathrm{U}(1)$.  By using projective structures and indigenous bundles on compact Riemann surfaces, we construct a canonical surjective map from the moduli space of stable extensions of two line bundles to that of irreducible cone spherical metrics with cone angles in $2\pi \mathbb{Z}$. We also prove that the map is generically injective in algebro-geometric sense if the Riemann surface has genus $>1$. As an application, we obtain some new existence results about irreducible cone spherical metrics. This is a joint work with Lingguang Li and Bin Xu.

Title:&nbsp; Special locally conformally Kähler metrics

Abstract:&nbsp;  In this seminar I will describe a generalization of the Donaldson-Fujiki moment map picture to the locally conformally symplectic case, with the aim of defining a suitable notion of canonical metrics in this setting. The talk is based on joint work with D. Angella, S. Calamai and F. Pediconi.

Title:&nbsp; K3 surfaces with two involutions and low Picard number

Abstract:&nbsp; Having an automorphism is a non-trivial property for a complex K3 surface. Indeed, if X is a generic complex K3 surface of degree d >= 4, then the only automorphism of X is the identity. If X is a generic of degree d=2, then X admits only one involution beside the identity map. Hence a natural question arises: given a fixed positive even integer d, how special is it for a K3 surface of degree d to admit an involution? More precisely, what is the minimal Picard number h_d for a K3 surface of degree d in order to admit an involution as automorphism? In this talk we are going to show that h_d=2 for every d\geq 4. This is joint work with Wim Nijgh and Daniel Platt.

Title:&nbsp; Stochastic differentials on manifolds

Abstract:&nbsp; Despite the name, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are defined using integrals, but the standard notation hints at the existence of a “stochastic differential” in much the same way as the notation for deterministic integrals hints at the existence of differential forms. We will see how a stochastic differential can be rigorously defined and how this can be applied to give an elegant coordinate-free treatment of stochastic differential equations on manifolds

Title: The asymptotic geometry of the Hitchin moduli space

Abstract: Hitchin's equations are a system of gauge theoretic equations on a Riemann surface that are of interest in many areas including representation theory, Teichmüller theory, and the geometric Langlands correspondence. The Hitchin moduli space carries a natural hyperkähler metric.  An intricate conjectural description of its asymptotic structure appears in the work of Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke and there has been a lot of progress on this recently.  I will discuss some recent results using tools coming out of geometric analysis which are well-suited for verifying these extremely delicate conjectures. This strategy often stretches the limits of what can currently be done via geometric analysis, and simultaneously leads to new insights into these conjectures.
