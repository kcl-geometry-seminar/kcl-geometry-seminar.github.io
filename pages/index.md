The Seminar runs on *Tuesdays* at **STRAND BLDG S4.29**. This term, some talks will run from *15:00 to 16:00*, and others will be in two parts -- an introductory talk from *15:00 to 15:40* and a research talk from *15:45 to 16:30*.

Title:&nbsp; Generalising Euler’s Tonnetz 

Abstract:&nbsp; Euler in 1739 wrote about a way to visualise harmonic relationships in music thus creating what is now called `Euler’s Tonnetz’. This talk is about Euler’s tonnetz from a modern point of view, and how to generalise it. Our ‘Tonnetze’ will take place on triangulated surfaces. We will, in particular, consider a set of examples that live on triangulations of tori and are related to crystallographic reflection groups, and a diatonic example related to a famous finite geometry.

Title:&nbsp; Flat F-manifolds for Calabi-Yau smooth projective complete intersection varieties
 


Abstract:&nbsp; In this talk, I will explain how to construct formal flat F-manifold structures on the primitive cohomology H of a Calabi-Yau smooth projective complete intersection variety X. My strategy is to convert an analysis on H to study on non-isolated hypersurface singularities using the Cayley trick; we associate a dGBV (differential Gerstenhaber-Batalin-Vilkovisky) algebra A to H, and find a special solution to Maurer-Cartan equation in order to construct formal flat F-manifolds.

Title:&nbsp; Deformations of cyclic quotient surface singularities via mirror symmetry




Abstract:&nbsp; Let $X_0$ be a rational surface with a cyclic quotient singularity $(1,a)/r$.  Kawamata constructed a remarkable vector bundle $K_0$ on $X_0$ such that the finite-dimensional algebra $End(K_0)$, called the Kalck-Karmazyn algebra, "absorbs'' the singularity of $X_0$ in a categorical sense.  If we deform over an irreducible component of the versal deformation space of $X_0$ (as described by Kollár and Shepherd-Barron), the bundle $K_0$ also deforms to a vector bundle $K$. These results were established using abstract methods of birational geometry, making the explicit computation of the family of algebras challenging. We will utilise homological mirror symmetry to compute $End(K)$ explicitly. In the case of a Q-Gorenstein smoothing, this algebra $End(K)$ is a matrix order deforming the Kalck-Karmazyn algebra, and "absorbs" the singularity of the corresponding terminal 3-fold singularity. I will also discuss a conjecture describing irreducible components of the deformation space of $X_0$ in terms of the finite-dimensional algebra $End(K_0)$.

This is based on our joint work (on arXiv) with Jenia Tevelev.

Title:&nbsp; On the congruence subgroup property for mapping class groups of surfaces 

Abstract:&nbsp; I will relate two notorious open questions in low-dimensional topology.  The first asks whether every hyperbolic group is residually finite. The second, the  congruence subgroup property, relates the finite-index subgroups of mapping class groups of surfaces to the topology of the underlying surface. I will explain why, if every hyperbolic group is residually finite, then mapping class groups enjoy the congruence subgroup property. If there’s time, I may give some further applications to the question of whether hyperbolic 3-manifolds are determined by the finite quotients of their fundamental groups.
